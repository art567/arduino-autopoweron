Automatic "Power ON"
====================

Arduino - Automatic "Power ON" button.

Features
---------------------
This is very simple sketch program to push button after voltage being applied to your device.

I recommend to switch LOW/HIGH levels if you experience any troubles with double pushing.

If you wish to modify the code or add any additional features, please feel free to make a **fork** and submit a [pull request].

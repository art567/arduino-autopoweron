Automatic "Power ON"
====================

Arduino - Automatic "Power ON" button.

Features
---------------------
This is very simple sketch program to push button after voltage being applied to your device.

You can use these cheap boards and integrate it anywhere:

Mini - This is the smallest Arduino board. It works well in a breadboard or for applications in which space is at a premium.



I recommend to switch LOW/HIGH levels if you experience any troubles with double pushing.

On my purpose I've switched LOW<->HIGH signal levels for Wintel CX-W8 mini PC.

If you wish to modify the code or add any additional features, please feel free to make a **fork** and submit a [pull request].
